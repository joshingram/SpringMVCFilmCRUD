<h2 align="center">Description</h2>
<p>This application simulates a web based interface for interacting with a movie rental store chain's database.  The user has full CRUD abilities (on limited records). 
The end user can search for films or actors by ID# or keyword.  If a matching film or actor is found, those details are displayed, 
if a film or actor is not found, an appropriate message is shown.  The user can also add a film to the database by entering its details.  Conversely,
the user can delete a film or actor (that they created) from the database. A film can also be updated in the database. If a film is found, the user also has the ability to check SD Video's "nationwide" inventory of that item, showing if a rental is checked out and to whom.</p>

<a name="readme-learned"></a>
<h2 align="center">Things learned</h2>
<p>We learned how to work together on the same project while using git. We learned that if a mistake is made while using git, and a merge conflict happens, it can be a real pain to fix that issue. Something that we worked out fairly quickly was to notify the other member of our group what we're working on and when we're done with that file to reduce the possibility of a merge conflict. Finally, we learned to work independently until we encountered an error we couldn't solve then have the other member of the group help where we got stuck. This helped with productivity, rate of completion of the program, and catching mistakes the other group member made as we went along.</p>

<h2 align="center">Things to do next time</h2>
<p>Next time, we would like to add more features, such as an about us page for each of the stores that shows the staff and fake pictures of the staff, and show a historical checkout for each film/inventory item.</p>

<h2 align="center">Things of Note</h2>
<p>When the inventory of a film is shown, if that specific item is checked out, it shows the customer's name and address. Also of note, while it is hard to see, the "SD Video" logo shows up in the image for a tab.</p>
